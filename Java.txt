SuperClass&SubClasses

In Super Class we can specify the design how we going to build the Objects
We can create constuctor and Methods like Setter and Getter.
In Sub Class we can EXTEND CLASS SUPER AND IN SUB CLASSES WE CAN Change the
value of Getter method to spesific object. IF we created method Getter in
SuperClass Eat() or Speak() that print values from constuctor System.out.println("hello my" +name +age)
We can change this in Subclass for whatever we want ("Buy"+name+age);
Demo is executer we can keep Public static void main(Str[] args) to execute whatever we want.
